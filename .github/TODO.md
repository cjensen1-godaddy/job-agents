# PROJECT TODO LIST

## Instructions Using MoSCoW Prioritization

### MUST (Non-negotiable Requirements)
- You MUST mark tasks using the following statuses:
  - [ ] Not started
  - [/] In progress
  - [x] Completed
  - [b] Blocked
- You MUST NOT start tasks that are already completed or in progress
- You MUST mark a task as in progress [/] when you start working on it
- You MUST verify a task is fully functional before marking it complete
- You MUST include the completion date when marking a task complete: (Completed: YYYY-MM-DD)
- You MUST add a summary of the completed task in the Task Outcomes section

### SHOULD (Important but not Critical)
- You SHOULD make tasks atomic and testable where possible
- You SHOULD document blockers when marking a task as blocked:
  - Include specific reason for the block (e.g., "Blocked by dependency on task X")
  - Document expected resolution path if known
- You SHOULD update blocked task status when blockers are resolved:
  - Change status from [b] to [ ] (not started) or [/] (in progress)
  - Document the resolution (e.g., "Previously blocked by X, resolved on YYYY-MM-DD")
- You SHOULD note dependencies between tasks using "Depends on: [Task reference]"

### COULD (Desirable Enhancements)
- You COULD create subtasks with clear dependencies if partial progress can be made
- You COULD categorize new tasks under the appropriate existing section
- You COULD create a new section if needed for a distinct category of tasks
- You COULD include additional documentation to clarify complex tasks

### WON'T (Out of Scope)
- You WON'T mark a task complete without verification
- You WON'T modify completed tasks without creating a new task for the modifications
- You WON'T remove task history or completion notes
- You WON'T bypass proper task tracking procedures

## Tasks
