- Begin every response by stating current mode and fencing status
- Check .github/code-mode.md to determine current mode and fencing status
- Default to Code Monkey mode unless instructed otherwise
- Track active mode in .github/code-mode.md
- Request permission when encountering coding issues requiring approach changes
- Wait for permission before proceeding with alternative approaches
- Make no code or test changes outside fenced directory (if fenced)
  - Exceptions: TODO.md and code-mode.md files
- Request explicit permission for changes outside fenced area

## Project Architecture

### Component Overview
- The project consists of multiple packages with specific responsibilities:
  - action-center: Front-end UI and entry point
  - action-database: Data persistence layer
  - action-executor: Execution engine for actions
  - action-service: Core service layer
  - action-steps: Implementation of workflow steps
  - action-toolkit: Shared utilities and tools

### Cross-Component Guidelines
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between components
- Follow established dependency hierarchy
- Ensure backward compatibility when modifying shared interfaces
- Use the appropriate test frameworks for each component
- Consider impacts on all dependent components when making changes

## Technology Standards

### Language and Module System
- Use TypeScript for all new code development
- Use ES modules (ESM) exclusively, not CommonJS (CJS)
- Maintain strict typing with explicit type declarations
- Prefer async/await over Promise chains
- Use modern JavaScript features supported by Node.js 18+

### Framework Preferences
- Prefer Vitest over Jest for unit and integration testing
- Use Cucumber with Vitest for BDD-style testing
- Avoid CommonJS-based tools and libraries when alternatives exist
- Prefer native ESM-compatible dependencies
- Use ESM import/export syntax consistently

## Testing Standards

### Testing Frameworks
- Cucumber: Used for BDD-style tests and integration tests
- Vitest: Primary testing framework for all unit and component tests
  - Replaces Jest in all components where possible

### Testing Requirements
- All new code must include appropriate tests
- Follow the established patterns in each component
- Prefer test-driven development (TDD) when implementing new features
- Run the full test suite (`./run-all-tests.js`) to verify changes
- Check test coverage with coverage reports when adding new code
- Write tests using ES modules, not CommonJS
- Configure all testing tools to use ESM mode

## Quality Check Requirements

### Required Quality Checks
- Before marking any Task Rabbit task as complete, run all of these checks:
  - Run TypeScript type checking: `node scripts/code-quality/check-typescript-errors.js`
  - Run tests with coverage: `npm run coverage`
  - Run package compliance checks: `node scripts/check-package-compliance.js`
  - Check for unused code: `node scripts/code-quality/find-unused-code.js`
  - Ensure minimum 80% test coverage for new code

### Code Coverage Standards
- All code must maintain a minimum of:
  - 80% statement coverage
  - 70% branch coverage
  - 80% function coverage
  - 80% line coverage
- Coverage reports are generated at `coverage-report/index.html`
- Check coverage with `npm run coverage:summary`

### Package Compliance Requirements
- All dependencies must comply with license requirements
- GoDaddy-owned modules must not specify open source licenses
- Third-party packages must use approved licenses only
- Run compliance checks with `node scripts/check-package-compliance.js`
- Fix license issues with `node scripts/check-package-compliance.js --fix`

### Error Remediation
- TypeScript errors must be fixed before completing any task
- Unused code should be removed unless it serves a documented purpose
- If test failures occur, they must be fixed before completing the task
- Always document any quality check errors that cannot be resolved and why
- Request assistance when facing persistent quality issues

## Project-Specific Commands

### Build Commands
- Build all packages: `npm run build`
- Build specific package: `cd <package-dir> && npm run build`

### Test Commands
- Run all tests: `npm run test`
- Run tests with details: `npm run test:v`
- Run tests for specific package: `npm run test:<package-name>`

### Quality Commands
- Generate coverage report: `npm run coverage`
- Show coverage summary: `npm run coverage:summary`
- Clean coverage data: `npm run coverage:clean`
- Check package compliance: `node scripts/check-package-compliance.js`
- Find unused code: `node scripts/code-quality/find-unused-code.js`
- Check TypeScript errors: `node scripts/code-quality/check-typescript-errors.js`"#,
